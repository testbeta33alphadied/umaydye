<h1>Top 5 best online games of 2021</h1>
<br>
<h2>5. Apex Legends</h2>
<img src="./ha_files/apex.jpg" width="500" alt="" srcset="">
<p style="width: 100%;">Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale-hero shooter game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by
Electronic Arts. It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in February 2019, for Nintendo
Switch in March 2021, and for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in March 2022. A mobile version of the game specially
designed for touchscreens titled Apex Legends Mobile has also been announced which was released May 17, 2022 on Android
and iOS. The game supports cross-platform play, excluding the mentioned mobile platforms.

Before the match, players form into two- or three-player squads, and select from pre-designed characters with
distinctive abilities, known as "Legends". The game has two gameplay modes. In "Battle Royale", up to 20 three-person
squads or 30 two-person duos land on an island and search for weapons and supplies before attempting to defeat all other
players in combat. The available play area on the island shrinks over time, forcing players to keep moving or else find
themselves outside the play area which can be fatal. The final team alive wins the round. In "Arenas", players form into
three-player squads and fight against another squad in a 3v3 team deathmatch over a series of rounds to determine the
winner of the match. Teams win when their team has at least 3 points and is 2 points ahead</p>

Warfare and is connected to 2020's Call of Duty: Black Ops: Cold War and 2021's Call of Duty: Vanguard, but does not
require purchase of any of the aforementioned titles, and was introduced during Season 2 of Modern Warfare content.
Warzone was developed by Infinity Ward and Raven Software (the latter later credited as the sole developer following the
integration of Cold War's content) and published by Activision.[3] Warzone allows online multiplayer combat among 150
players, although some limited-time game modes support 200 players. The game features both cross-platform play and
cross-platform progression between the three aforementioned titles</p>

<h2>3. Counter Strike: Global Offensive</h2>
<img src="./ha_files/csgo.jpeg" width="500" alt="" srcset="">
<p style="width: 100%;">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) is a 2012 multiplayer first-person shooter developed by Valve and Hidden Path
Entertainment. It is the fourth game in the Counter-Strike series. Developed for over two years, Global Offensive was
released for Windows, macOS, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 in August 2012, and for Linux in 2014. Valve still regularly
updates the game, both with smaller balancing patches and larger content additions.

The game pits two teams, Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, against each other in different objective-based game modes.
The most common game modes involve the Terrorists planting a bomb while Counter-Terrorists attempt to stop them, or
Counter-Terrorists attempting to rescue hostages that the Terrorists have captured. There are nine official game modes,
all of which have distinct characteristics specific to that mode. The game also has matchmaking support that allows
players to play on dedicated Valve servers, in addition to community-hosted servers with custom maps and game modes. A
battle-royale game-mode, "Danger Zone", was introduced in December 2018.</p>

<h2>2. PUBG</h2>
<img src="./ha_files/pung.jpg" width="500" alt="" srcset="">
<p style="width: 100%;">PUBG: Battlegrounds (previously known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) is a battle royale game developed and published
by PUBG Studios, a subsidiary of Krafton. The game, which was inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, is based
on previous mods created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, and expanded into a standalone game under
Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island where they scavenge for
weapons and equipment to kill other players while avoiding getting killed themselves. The available safe area of the
game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into an ever tightening space to force encounters.
The last surviving player (or team) wins the round. This is the first game in the series, named PUBG Universe.</p>

<h2>1. Valorant</h2>
<img src="./ha_files/valorant.jpg" width="500" alt="" srcset="">
<p style="width: 100%;">Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter set in the near future.[2][3][4][5] Players play as one of a set of
Agents, characters based on several countries and cultures around the world.[5] In the main game mode, players are
assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique
abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths,
orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability"
charges.[3] Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based
on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed. The game
has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns,
machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles.[6][7] There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a
unique shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately.[7] It currently offers
19 agents to choose from.[8][9] They are Brimstone, Viper, Omen, Cypher, Sova, Sage, Phoenix, Jett, Raze, Breach, Reyna,
Killjoy, Skye, Yoru, Astra, KAY/O, Chamber, Neon, and Fade.</p>
